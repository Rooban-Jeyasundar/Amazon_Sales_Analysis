# Amazon_Sales_Analysis
EDA project on Amazon Sales Data

📊 This project is about an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Amazon's sales dataset using Python. 🚀

📍 Aim of the project:

The aim of this project was to analyze Amazon's order data to uncover valuable insights. By examining various data features and their relationships, we aimed to understand the impact of each feature and how it influences overall results.

📝 Process followed in the project:

**Data Preparation:**
* Imported essential libraries like Numpy, Pandas etc.. and then pre-process the data to clean the dataset to ensure it was ready for analysis.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
* Explored the dataset to study the relationships among features in the data.
* Analyzed the impact of different features on sales performance.
**Insights & Strategic Planning:**
*Generated actionable insights to guide future business decisions and strategies.

📊 Key Findings:

**1. Product Sizes:**
* Customers predominantly order apparel in sizes M, L, and XL. This insight suggests that focusing on these sizes for new models, offers, and products could further boost business growth.
**2. Geographical Distribution:**
* Analyzed the geographical distribution of orders to improve supply chain efficiency. We identified the need to enhance order handling in top-performing states while also increasing efforts in less-contributed states through regional promotions and localized advertising.
**3. Trend Analysis:**
* A line chart showed that the highest order volume occurs in the first half of April. This helps in understanding peak times and addressing periods with lower order volumes to ensure consistent performance throughout the year.
**4. Category Distribution:**
* The pie chart analysis of order distribution across categories revealed key areas for maintaining product quality and expanding the customer base. Focusing on high-demand items and improving other product categories will help in growing revenue.

✅ Conclusion:

The insights gained from this analysis are instrumental in refining business strategies. By leveraging these findings, we can enhance product offerings, optimize supply chain operations, and implement targeted marketing strategies to foster business growth.
